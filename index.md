### Description

This project is a simulation of the [Jenga game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga) in Virtual Reality environment. In the game, player can move physically move around within the play area or using thumbstick to turn or teleport. This allows player to have unbounded views of the jenga tower. The game allows player to perform most of the natural interactions when playing Jenga in real world. For example pointing 1 index finger out to push a block or using 2 fingers to pickup and drop a block. Player can also throw blocks. The game also can be very effective in creating frustration for players when the tower falls 😜 !!

The game is tested with Oculus Quest 2. Quest 2 controllers have partial [skeletal (finger) tracking](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/articles/Skeleton-Input.html) ability.
